# DBM-RawData
Note: All my Raw Data requires beta and the most recent mods!

SuggestionCommands - The folder containing my suggestion RD. This includes 2 commands.

2 commands:
[p]suggestchan [#channel]
[p]suggest [suggestion]

--Advanced Commmands, include error messages, missing permission messages, and even a check variable to stop a user from suggesting if the suggest channel is not set!

Very nice, all embeds
Requires latest MODS and DBM Beta
